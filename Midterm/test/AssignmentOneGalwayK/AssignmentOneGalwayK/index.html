                Hey there!
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Kyle Galway. I’m a student in Sheridan’s Computer Systems Technician two-year diploma program, currently in my fourth and final semester before I graduate. After I do so, I’m planning on transferring to and earning my Bachelor's Degree in Sheridan's Computer Science program specializing in Data Analytics.
            </p>
                At Sheridan, I have learned a great number of skills related to the fields of Software Development and Computer Science. I am an adept Java programmer and am experienced in Java Enterprise development, and am highly knowledgeable in the use of JavaScript for array processing and DOM manipulation. I am also highly skilled in Database Operations for both relational and non-relational Database Managament Systems.
            <p> 
                I recently completed my first co-op work semester, where I worked on a research project sponsored by Rogers in Sheridan’s own Centre for Mobile Innovation research labs. During this time, I used the Python programming language to create a vehicle data collection device and related backend server application for collecting and uploading vehicle diagnostics.
